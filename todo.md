## 📊 MFE Boilerplate Development Status

| Feature Area | Specifications in README | Status | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Monorepo Setup** | npm workspaces layout for `apps/` and `packages/` | **✅ Done** | Configured `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and Tailwind CSS compilation. |
| **Module Federation** | Host container loading 3 remote MFEs dynamically at runtime | **✅ Done** | Exposes and imports remotes dynamically using Vite Module Federation on localhost ports 5000-5003. |
| **Shared Stores** | Zustand state for Auth, Player, and UI stores | **✅ Done** | Implemented state, getters, and actions inside `packages/shared-store`. |
| **Shared Custom Hooks** | Facade hooks wrapping stores (`useAuth`, `usePlayer`, `useTheme`, `useSearch`, `useDebounce`) | **✅ Done** | Implemented under `packages/shared-hooks`. |
| **Shared UI System** | 12 common styled components (`Button`, `Card`, `Badge`, `Avatar`, `Search`, `Dropdown`, `Tabs`, `Tooltip`, `Modal`, `Spinner`, `VideoCard`, `CommentCard`) | **✅ Done** | Fully implemented using Tailwind CSS styling under `packages/shared-ui`. |
| **HLS Player core** | Native `<video>` integration using `hls.js` with statistics tracking | **✅ Done** | Implemented in `apps/player` with buffer and dropped frame statistics, volume controls, and rate settings. |
| **IPTV-org Metadata** | Categories, Country filter, search filter, and Grid layout | **✅ Done** | Fully integrated mock search/filtering flow in the Video Browser grid. |
| **Storybook** | Storybook documentation and testing of shared components | **⏳ Pending** | We need to configure Storybook configurations and write stories (`*.stories.tsx`) for the components under `shared-ui`. |
| **Real Firebase Integration** | Live Authentication flow (Google/Email) and Realtime Firestore sync (for Comments/History/Favorites) | **⏳ Pending** | Firebase Client is initialized in `packages/firebase`, but `apps/community` and `apps/host` currently use in-memory state fallbacks for comments and demo user sessions. We need to replace these mocks with active Firestore listener subscriptions (`onSnapshot`, `addDoc`). |
| **Keyboard Shortcuts** | Player keyboard events (Space, M, F, Arrow Keys) | **⏳ Pending** | We need to add the `window.addEventListener('keydown')` listener inside the Player MFE. |
| **i18n Translation** | English / Hindi localization translations | **⏳ Pending** | The store supports toggling the language, but we need to implement i18n dictionaries for both locales. |
| **Continue Watching** | Tracking playback position (`currentTime`) in Firestore | **⏳ Pending** | We need to write position coordinates updates into Firestore. |
| **Deployments** | Multi-target independent deployment setup on Vercel | **⏳ Pending** | We need to set up production target endpoints and `vercel.json` redirection config rules. |
