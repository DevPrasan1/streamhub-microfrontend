# 🚀 React Vite Module Federation Boilerplate (Micro Frontend)

> **A production-ready Micro Frontend (MFE) boilerplate built with React 19, Vite, Module Federation, TypeScript, Storybook 10, Zustand, and a local Mock API.**
>
> 🌐 **Live Production Demo**: [micro-frontend-vite-boilerplate.netlify.app](https://micro-frontend-vite-boilerplate.netlify.app/)
>
> **A production-inspired E-Commerce Product Catalog platform built with React, Vite, Module Federation, Storybook, Zustand, and a local Mock API.**
>
> The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a large enterprise e-commerce application can be split into independently developed and deployed Micro-Frontends (MFEs).
>
> 📖 **Developer Workflows**: For instructions on running standalone commands, integrated hot-rebuild environments, and workspace scripts cataloging, refer to [workflow.md](./workflow.md).
>
> 🏗️ **MFE Boilerplate Guide**: To use this repository as a template or boilerplate for your own React Module Federation monorepo, see [BOILERPLATE.md](./BOILERPLATE.md).

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **React 19 & TypeScript 5** – Clean domain types and standard React 19 component structures.
- ✅ **Vite 5** – Sub-second Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized build outputs.
- ✅ **Module Federation** – Dynamic runtime script sharing and remote application loading using `@originjs/vite-plugin-federation`.
- ✅ **Dynamic Remotes** – Resilient mounting and error boundary isolation across all micro-frontends.
- ✅ **Shared Zustand Store** – Global state synchronization across MFE boundaries mapped to browser `window` context.
- ✅ **Storybook 10** – Isolated playground and documentation for shared design system UI components.
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS & PostCSS** – Unified, utility-first styling token patterns across apps and packages.
- ✅ **Authentication Flow** – Unified mock login session details shared dynamically at runtime.
- ✅ **Theme Switching** – Instant light/dark theme toggles synchronized across remote boundaries.
- ✅ **Mock Backend Services** – Persistent simulated client-side database utilizing browser `localStorage`.
- ✅ **CI/CD Quality Controls** – Automation workflows for formatting, compilation safety, and lint validation.
- ✅ **Independent Deployments** – Independently buildable and deployable MFE container and remotes.

## 💡 Why This Boilerplate?

Most Micro Frontend examples available online are:

- limited to simple demos
- based on Webpack
- missing shared state management
- difficult to extend for production use

This project demonstrates how to structure a scalable React application using Vite and Module Federation with patterns commonly found in enterprise environments.

## ⚙️ How Module Federation Works Here

Each micro frontend is independently built and deployed while sharing common libraries at runtime using Module Federation:

1. **Host (`apps/host`)** requests remote entrypoints from target domains (e.g. `http://localhost:5001/assets/remoteEntry.js`).
2. **Remotes (`apps/product-catalog`, etc.)** expose React components which get dynamically loaded over the network only when the user navigates to those sub-routes.
3. Common dependencies like `react`, `react-dom`, and `zustand` are shared, ensuring that each library is only loaded **once** in the browser, matching the optimal bundle-sharing setup of a monolith.

The values below represent optimized builds running locally:

| Metric | Host Shell Container | Product Catalog MFE | Product Details MFE | Product Reviews MFE |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Startup Time (Dev)** | ~95ms | ~90ms | ~92ms | ~91ms |
| **Build Time** | ~740ms | ~590ms | ~740ms | ~690ms |
| **Production Bundle Size** | ~106 kB | ~98 kB | ~98 kB | ~98 kB |
| **Remote Entry script** | - | 3.74 kB | 3.44 kB | 3.44 kB |
| **Lighthouse Performance** | 99+ | 99+ | 99+ | 99+ |
