# StreamHub - Video Management Platform (Micro-Frontend)

> **A production-inspired Video Management Platform built with React, Vite, Module Federation, Firebase, Storybook, and Zustand.**
>
> The goal of this project is **not to clone YouTube**, but to demonstrate how a large enterprise application can be split into independently developed and deployed Micro-Frontends.
>
> 📖 **Developer Workflows**: For instructions on running standalone commands, integrated hot-rebuild environments, and workspace scripts cataloging, refer to [workflow.md](file:///Users/devprasan/Documents/video-management-software-with-MFE/workflow.md).

# 3. High Level Architecture

# 4. Why Micro-Frontend?

Imagine a company with 3 frontend teams.

```
Team A
↓

Video Browser

-------------------

Team B
↓

Player

-------------------

Team C
↓

Community
```

Every team

* develops independently
* deploys independently
* owns its domain

Exactly what Module Federation was designed for.

# 5. Applications

```
apps/

host/

video-browser/

player/

community/
```

---

# 6. Packages

```
packages/

shared-ui/

shared-store/

shared-hooks/

shared-utils/

shared-types/

firebase/
```

No application imports code directly from another application.

Everything reusable lives in packages.

# 12. YouTube Video Library & Scripts

The application manages data using a parsed JSON library, **`yt-videos.json`**, populated from your YouTube CSV extracts:

### Video Parsing (`scripts/parse-csv.js`)
A Node utility script that parses standard YouTube export sheets, strips formatting commas on numeric views, runs category regex heuristics to group clips by actor, and exports them directly into `packages/shared-utils/src/yt-videos.json`.

### Stream Verification (`scripts/check-streams.js`)
An offline worker pool verifier that tests IPTV streams concurrently, limits timeouts to 10s, logs testing updates, and executes periodic auto-saves after every 500 checked streams to prevent data loss.
