## 💡 Why this boilerplate?

Most Module Federation examples are:

- outdated
- webpack only
- incomplete
- not production ready

This repository demonstrates how to build scalable React Micro Frontends using Vite, Module Federation, Storybook, and Zustand with an enterprise-ready project structure.

## 🚀 Use This Repository

Click **Use this template** to create your own project.

No need to fork. The boilerplate is ready for production development.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started locally:

1. Clone your newly created repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-new-repo-url>
   cd micro-frontend-vite-boilerplate
   ```
2. Install the workspaces and dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the interactive development build:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:mfe
   ```
   Open **[http://localhost:5005](http://localhost:5005)** inside your browser to start coding.

## ⚙️ How Module Federation Works Here

Each micro frontend is independently built and deployed while sharing common libraries at runtime using Module Federation:

1. **Host (`apps/host`)** requests remote entrypoints from target domains (e.g. `http://localhost:5001/assets/remoteEntry.js`).
2. **Remotes (`apps/product-catalog`, etc.)** expose React components which get dynamically loaded over the network only when the user navigates to those sub-routes.
3. Common dependencies like `react`, `react-dom`, and `zustand` are shared, ensuring that each library is only loaded **once** in the browser, matching the optimal bundle-sharing setup of a monolith.
